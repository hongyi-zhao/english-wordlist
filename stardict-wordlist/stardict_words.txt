Th√©r√®se de Lisieux
There's many a good tune played on an old fiddle.
There's many a slip 'twixt the cup and the lip.
There's many a true word spoken in jest.
There's more than one way to skin a cat.
There's no accounting for taste.
There's nobody home.
There's no flies on someone.
There's no fool like an old fool.
There's none so blind as those who will not see.
There's none so deaf as those who will not hear.
There's no place like home.
There's no rose without a thorn.
There's no smoke without fire.
There's no such thing as a free lunch.
There's nothing to it!
There's no time like the present.
There's no way to tell.
