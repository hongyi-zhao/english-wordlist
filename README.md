See [here](https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/help-gnu-emacs/2021-08/msg00138.html) for the motivation of the repository. Basically, the aim is to build an exhaustive while healthy/reasonable Enaglish word list for ispell and company-ispell, hence the name [american-english-healthy](https://github.com/hongyi-zhao/english-wordlist/blob/master/american-english-healthy) is used. The target audience is academic research and technology users who use Emacs as a way of life.

The word list [Webster_s_Unabridged_3.txt](https://github.com/hongyi-zhao/english-wordlist/blob/master/Webster_s_Unabridged_3.txt) is generated by [pyglossary](https://github.com/ilius/pyglossary), with the following steps which I've described [here](https://github.com/company-mode/company-mode/issues/1146#issuecomment-886172208):

```
$ sudo apt-get install python3-tk tix
# pyenv python environment for this operation:
$ pyenv shell datasci
$ pip install gobject PyGObject pyglossary
$ mkdir -p ~/.stardict/dic && cd $_
$ curl -O http://download.huzheng.org/bigdict/stardict-Webster_s_Unabridged_3-2.4.2.tar.bz2
$ tar xvf stardict-Webster_s_Unabridged_3-2.4.2.tar.bz2
$ cd stardict-Webster_s_Unabridged_3-2.4.2
$ pyglossary Webster_s_Unabridged_3.ifo Webster_s_Unabridged_3.csv
$ awk -F, 'NR > 8 {sub(/^["]/,"",$1);sub(/["]$/,"",$1);print $1}' Webster_s_Unabridged_3.csv > Webster_s_Unabridged_3.txt
```
The word list [american-english-insane](https://github.com/hongyi-zhao/english-wordlist/blob/master/american-english-insane) is generated by [SCOWL Custom List/Dictionary Creator](http://app.aspell.net/create) with the following option:

Finally the word list [american-english-healthy](https://github.com/hongyi-zhao/english-wordlist/blob/master/american-english-healthy) is generated by the following command:
